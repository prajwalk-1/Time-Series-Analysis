# Time Series Analysis 

## Introduction

  **Time Series Analysis is a statistical method used to analyze data points collected, recorded, or measured over a period of time, typically at regular intervals. It aims to uncover patterns, trends, and     relationships within the data to make predictions or understand the underlying processes.**
  
  **In the context of stocks, Time Series Analysis can be used to analyze historical stock price data to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns that can help investors make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks.**
  
  **For example, consider the daily closing prices of a particular stock over the past year. By applying Time Series Analysis techniques, such as calculating moving averages, identifying trends, or fitting forecasting models, we can analyze the historical data to:**

  1. Identify trends: Determine whether the stock price has been increasing, decreasing, or remaining relatively stable over time.
  2. Detect seasonality: Identify recurring patterns or cycles in the stock price that occur at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly fluctuations.
  3. Make forecasts: Use historical data to predict future stock prices, allowing investors to anticipate potential price movements and make informed investment decisions.

## Python Code Overview

The provided Python code fetches historical stock price data of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using the yfinance API. It then visualizes the data using Plotly to analyze trends in stock prices over time. The code is divided into the following sections:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical stock price data using the yfinance library.
2. **Line Plot**: Visualizes the trends in close prices of Apple using a line plot.
3. **Candlestick Chart**: Visualizes the trends in open, high, low, and close prices of Apple using a candlestick chart.
4. **Bar Plot**: Visualizes the trends in close prices of Apple over the entire period using a bar plot.
5. **Custom Date Range Analysis**: Demonstrates how to analyze stock prices within a specific date range.
6. **Time Series Techniques**:
   - **Moving Average (MA)**: Calculate moving averages to analyze trends over time.
   - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Calculate exponential moving averages to give more weight to recent data points.
   - **Bollinger Band**: Calculate upper and lower Bollinger Bands to identify potential reversal points.

## Results

The Python code generates visualizations to analyze the trends in stock prices of Apple Inc. These visualizations include:

- Line plot showing trends in close prices over time.
- Candlestick chart displaying open, high, low, and close prices.
- Bar plot representing long-term trends in close prices.
- Custom date range analysis for specific time periods.
